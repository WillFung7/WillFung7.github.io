Welcome to my site. This site is mainly used for documenting my accelerator physics PhD research at MSU, as well as including other related accelerator-based topics. I work on luminosity optimization at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), Beam-Based Modeling techiniques, as well as Machine Learning techniques to improve modeling elements. 

I also wanted to make things interactive not only for myself and my own understanding but also for other users to get a feel for certain topics, systems, and dynamics in accelerator physics systems without having to code it or imagine it themselves and also look at all the math behind it.
