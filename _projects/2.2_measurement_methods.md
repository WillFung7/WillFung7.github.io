# Optics Measurement Methods from BPMs

## 1. Harmonic Analysis
## 2. Curve Fitting
## 3. Model Independent Analysis
### 3.1 Principal Component Analysis
### 3.2 Independent Component Analysis
### 3.3 Dynamic Mode Decomposition

## 4. N-BPM Methods
Beta from phase instead of amplitude
-  Independent of BPM calibration and tilt errors
and of being insensitive to betatron coupling to first
order
- assumes perfect timing synchronization and no optics errors
